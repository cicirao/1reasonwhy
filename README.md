Analysis of three-month #1reasonwhy Tweets

* This repository only include all Python codes, not any data.
* The raw data comes from [GNIP](http://gnip.com/) Twitter data.

'1ReasonWhy' is a Twitter hashtag created by people who care about the unfair treatment to women in the game industry. According to our current research, peopleâ€™s focus has been expanded to not only women in the game industry but also all women gamers. This project is aiming at analyzing three-month tweets with #1ReasonWhy in order to understand the humanities knowledge behind.

##Curation
The Curation code parsed the raw data from GNIP and output the clean data with new schema.    
GNIP has a huge [documentation](http://support.gnip.com/sources/twitter/data_format.html), sometimes it causes confusion.    
This is our clean data(in JSON):
