Text Analysis comparing 2 separate weeks of data taken from #OneReasonWhy API Twitter JSON files
	First Week data file -- 11/25/2012 to 12/03/2012
	Last Week data file --12/24/2012 to 1/1/2013

first.py parses the JSON files to retrieve the tweet messages from the two files.  Placed these two strings into two separate Tagul Word Clouds to analyze trending words, both visually by the clouds, and numerically by the number of times the first eighteen words for each week appeared.
