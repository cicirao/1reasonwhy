35 yrs ago chances were obviously not equal for m or f choosing to become a gamedev. Reducing to sexist etc. is too simplifying #1reasonwhy

Wait, is it #1reasonwhy or #1ReasonWhy?
Because every disclosure of harassment  feels like risking never being hired again. #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy 'Cos your views as a gamer are dismissed because you're a woman, and your views as a woman are dismissed because you're a gamer.
#1reasonwhy females are undercut in the game industry? Hey don't look at me! My entire series surrounds a girl AND is named after her!
#1reasonwhy because if we were in a traditional office, the way I'm treated would be considered sexual harassment.
Mesmerised by the #1reasonwhy hashtag this morning. If you've ever wondered why there aren't many women in games, this will enlighten you.

#1reasonwhy men like me are badasses, so cool and hilarious. i'm a disrespectful loudmouthed bitch.

#1reasonwhy Because even though she is the title of the flipping GAME, Zelda is still a shitty side character.
#1reasonwhy Because getting a female character who is NOT all about the T&amp;A some screen-time is still so very, very far from the norm.
#1reasonwhy Sometimes I feel that I have to work twice as hard in order for people to take me seriously.
Blah.  Just last week #1reasonwhy was an issue I felt passionately about.  I fear compassion fatigue has set in once again.
Because I'm constantly told by fellow devs that mostly guys buy games, so there's no reason to appeal to women. #1reasonwhy

#1reasonwhy Because your gender shouldn't remotely factor to being able to do the things you love without fear of harassment...or worse.
#1ReasonWhy because i'm not allowed to have a sexuality that isn't externalized &amp; controlled. my body &amp; actions are seen as public property.

#1ReasonWhy is sadly not an eye opener. Sexism is rampant across all industries, not just tech.Keep making 'noise' or it won't change.

#1reasonwhy -- because the game industry needs to do a better job overall of embracing diversity... gender, racial, ethnic, cultural.
#1ReasonWhy Because male game publishers still think that the market consists of teenage boys, and men who have the tastes of teenage boys.
RT @KCoxDC #1reasonwhy because every time I write about my own first-hand observations and lived experience, I am told I am wrong.
Dudes: Let #1reasonwhy wash over you and accept that maybe a lifetime as a dude hasn't made you an expert on what life is like for women.
#1reasonwhy because it's not worth the crunch time and low pay to work on boob physics at a "frat house"
Hope all this #1reasonwhy stuff leads to a positive change and not the angry backlash I suspect. There's a lot of dudebros on the net.
Maybe that's #1ReasonWhy right there: so that someday we can discuss the topic of gender without it becoming a screaming match.
Seriously, people won't understand this lopsided representation is a problem until we're willing to call it exactly that. #1ReasonWhy
#1reasonwhy because even if I do get a job at a studio with a good environment, I will probably end up getting laid off post release.
Many different and completely separate issues being discussed in this #1reasonwhy trend and they're all now one big indistinguishable mess.
There's an interesting discussion going on at the moment about women in the gaming industry. Take a look at #1ReasonWhy and #1ReasonMentors.
Because what the ignorant choose to call 'banter' is actually hurtful and denigrating (I have been guilty of this) #1reasonwhy

i love videogames and makes me depressed reading the #1reasonwhy hashtag. literally the worst, we need to stop the sexism
#1reasonwhy Because if men disagree with you, they're desperate to chalk it up to you being a "fake girl geek" who isn't a REAL gamer.

The #1ReasonWhy movement is both an excellent and perturbing read. It's about sexism against women in the gaming industry. Lots to learn.
And I don't mean to undermine anyone's experience, I'm just rambling. Pay me no mind. Fuck it, I'm just going to shut up. #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy isn't too negative people.  What's negative is the fact that women in the industry are really treated like this.
Because I am confronted with rape or violence in the comments section of Hey Ash videos #1ReasonWhy

All the #1ReasonWhy tag is doing for me is making me believe I've never worked in the 'real' games industry. Which is pretty much spot on.

As far as I can tell, about 85% of the comments by men on the #1ReasonWhy hashtag are apotheoses of those reasons.

Follow #1reasonwhy. Shit may yet change if we keep at it.
The #1ReasonWhy hashtag seems to be full of the same tired attention-whore types hiding behind the mask of feminism.
@cuppy Well yeah. If you only focus on the positive, we don't have to reflect on how shitty we are, and no men have to feel bad. #1reasonwhy
RE: #1reasonwhy; this male supports equal opportunity for women in the gaming industry. WOO.

"The ending didn't suck: you're just upset you didn't get to have Joker's babies."  #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy is, as men, most of us can't, won't or don't understand, and we don't try nearly enough to. Because it's hard. We can do better.
Because apparently they have nothing better to do than rock the boat and start trouble. Romney shoulda won. #1reasonwhy
If I hear "Wow, it's so unusual to see a woman interested in this area!" one more time, I will scream. #1reasonwhy
I love making games, but playing them with my wife/daughter/sister/mom/grandma is more awesome. #sorrybros #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy Comments on interviews with male devs will be about the game, but for women devs it'll be about how she's fat, ugly, slutty etc.
The #1reasonwhy hashtag breaks my heart. I hope I can help lead the game industry into a better place.
RT @avantgame: women in games are sharing tonight #1reasonwhy there are so few women in games. check the hashtag.

#1reasonwhy Because even in player-progressive games I love like Wizard101 and Pirate101, we're STILL talking about the lack of female NPCs.
The #1reasonwhy thread is encouraging to women in the industry, and off-putting to men. As it should be, frankly.
#1Reasonwhy Because whenever any writer, female or male, highlights the issue we hear "Can't we get back to just enjoying the games?!"
@girlgamer check out #1ReasonWhy to help raise awareness on why it's hard to be a woman in the game industry.
#1reasonwhy is creativity knows no gender, and women shouldn't have to put up with BS just to join us in creating amazing experiences.

#1reasonwhy people don't want to accept the fact that Jennifer Hepler is a shitty writer and lumps the actual criticism in with the trolls.

You a male gamer? Regardless of type, look at #1ReasonWhy...I hate that the hobby I love does this...let's change, 1 gamer at a time... rnb
This #1reasonwhy thing is the main reasons I always felt awkward in my computer classes, and why I never thought to work in video games
Because as a chick it's difficult/weird to participate in the straight-guy homoerotic humour and team banter #1reasonwhy
Writing and designing about minority experiences is considered lazy, hobbyist work not deserving of money #1ReasonWhy

There's an interesting discussion going on at the moment about women in the gaming industry. Take a look at #1ReasonWhy and #1ReasonMentors.
I have to say some of these #1ReasonWhy tweets are really weird
#1reasonwhy and #1reasontobe are a good thing. It reminds me why I love my career communityand why I'm glad to stay. No gender. Just gamedev
#1Reasonwhy Because whenever any writer, female or male, highlights the issue we hear "Can't we get back to just enjoying the games?!"
Christ, reading these #1reasonwhy tweets makes me want to slit my wrists. PROTIP: Treat all humans like humans wtf,
Because we can't even complain about sexism in the gaming industry without men complaining that we're complaining. #1reasonwhy
Don't get me wrong. #1reasonwhy is off-putting to me too. However much of an "ally" I purport to be, I'm still not seeing the whole picture.

Because any time I drink with my co-workers, someone jokes about raping me. #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy Some old-fashioned Y-chromo monkeys can't seem to admit women can be as fun, as creative, as cool when it comes to games &amp; toys!
I wish I wasn't almost too scared to post this. Here's my #1reasonwhy: http://t.co/gUAl4v3B
Videogame playing and development involve skills, passion and learning, not gender #1ReasonWhy
#1reasonwhy the phenomenon isn't too new, just ask women in any male-dominated profession. Get in there young engineers - demographics help.

#1reasonwhy makes me feel rather lucky that I've rarely had to face sexism wrt the gaming industry. Except that one Game employee...

I don't know what this #1reasonwhy thing is. @YasminSadie, explain immediately.
Because I'm constantly told by fellow devs that mostly guys buy games, so there's no reason to appeal to women. #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy I've been assaulted by people in the industry and I'm terrified of even admitting that because I know my career will suffer.
#1reasonwhy Because when I wanted to write post telling women they weren't alone, I was told by women that *I* was alone, asking for drama.

@aleczandah #1reasonwhy We don't want Prince's and Princesses. What we need is People. #BreakingGenderArchetypes

@heyashwp How couldn't we?  You're not one of the best women in the industry, you're one of the PEOPLE #1reasonwhy could hope for
#1reasonwhy Once designed a set of icons and was told to make them "more masculine," because "idiots and dudes are our bread and butter."
Since a lot of my followers probably missed it, here's my reasons why: http://t.co/n51ZGOWJ #1reasonwhy

On the plus side, it's kind of nice that @kotaku has gone in 5 years from "Jade Raymond smells nice" to #1reasonwhy. Change is possible...
Thanks to all fellow women in games who face #1ReasonWhy, but keep going; designing, developing and collaborating. You are #1ReasonToBe.
Worried that #1reasonwhy just discouraged 5000 women from following their gamedev dreams. DON'T GIVE UP! Read #1reasontobe for positivity!
#1reasonwhy  Because eight years of creating events to help others have fun is too long to spend being treated like a glorified secretary.
“@NewStatesman: One reason why there's so few women in games. And another. And another… http://t.co/aXqdHJtX #1reasonwhy” @superanne

So ashamed of the experiences of #1reasonwhy, so proud of those who spoke up. We *will* change this! #1reasonmentors #gamedev
Hey #1reasonwhy I support your cause, but any article you link about the Dragon Age writing team is invalid because it contains Hepler.
Just for clarity sake, can someone finish the #1reasonwhy sentence for me? O.r.w. there are no women in games? O.r.w. I'm not making games?
#1reasonwhy is just an excuse for Feminists to push their agenda. Equality is fine, catering specifically to 1 side is fucking retarded.

Here's a devastating account of the crap women in the games business have to deal with. In 2012. #1reasonwhy http://t.co/lI94XX8V
Dudes: Let #1reasonwhy wash over you and accept that maybe a lifetime as a dude hasn't made you an expert on what life is like for women.
#1ReasonWhy There aren't more women working in gaming? Because I've been working in gaming since 1994 and you've never heard of me.
#1reasonwhy is important, but I’m creating #1reasontobe because I’d like female devs to share why they're in games &amp; what they get from it.

As @seanjreilly points out, that my tweet pointing people to #1reasonwhy seems more popular than those by women may also be #1reasonwhy… :/
I'm gonna guess without going on the site that Kotaku already have a huge white knighting article about the #1reasonwhy hash.
Twitter hashtag ‘#1ReasonWhy’ exposes sexism in game industry http://t.co/rFKTKmqZ
With the #1reasonwhy movement getting significant headway, it's fucking gross to see people blaming the backlash for poor choices as sexism.
#1reasonwhy vient de faire ma journée. Geek-Gamer Women,  Vous rockez la vie.
#1reasonwhy I don't give up is so that I can break the curve and open the way for the rest of you. Willing to be your wrecking ball.
Worried that #1reasonwhy just discouraged 5000 women from following their gamedev dreams. DON'T GIVE UP! Read #1reasontobe for positivity!
"Funny" guys who make misogynist comments, and knowing that if we call them on it, we "can't take a joke". #1reasonwhy
@elenielstorm @DaveSapien @gamasutra Absolutely! Lets have new, real, up-to-date images to represent this issue. #1reasonwhy
Oops read the comments on some of these #1reasonwhy articles. Goddamn INTERNET. Wish I hadn't already had lunch so I could eat my feelings.

#1ReasonWhy - The night Twitter took on the industry's sexism | GamesIndustry International http://t.co/dlwq2Xq8
More power to the lady devs of gaming. I wonder how long it'll be until we judge the developer on their work, not their gender. #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy because @gamasutra illustrates its article about #1reasonwhy with a photo of high heels http://t.co/QOoxa3YW
Everyone in gaming culture should read #1reasonwhy.
Because I can tweet &amp; still shit out a game better than a chick while dancing Gangnam style and scarfing nachos in MY basement. #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy - The night Twitter took on the gaming industry's sexism http://t.co/NHDR2P9Z
in my experience, #1reasonwhy is generalizable to the entire tech industry, too.  not just games.
Thats why Im in the industry #1reasonwhy some arent:ppl never assume Im important at events though I can control whether we cover their game
Because we can't even complain about sexism in the gaming industry without men complaining that we're complaining. #1reasonwhy
RT @raphkoster: #1reasonwhy http://t.co/ZpvXcnXZ http://t.co/lmsT7jh8 http://t.co/gujMJbOs http://t.co/AwmKklB1
I'm gonna guess without going on the site that Kotaku already have a huge white knighting article about the #1reasonwhy hash.
I would love to see the #1reasonwhy hastag be accompanied by a #1waytochange hashtag. How can we change the ratio and the respect?
#1reasonwhy Because creating appropriately dressed female characters is viewed as a rarity, rather than the norm.
Somewhat unrelated to #1ReasonWhy, made me wonder how many women-gamers would be willing to become devs in this country (not many men btw)

#1ReasonWhy sucks, the majority of my coding knowledge came from females in the industry, sad times.
I've been talking about the context that relates to #1reasonwhy for some time now. This industry/culture shouldn't be a dude-oriented one...
#1reasonwhy is an example plenty of talking and no doing. #sittingonyourass
#1reasonwhy Read what I retweeted...it's a huge problem. One that can hopefully be fixed. I normally don't retweet that much, but worth it.
Thank you, #1reasonwhy , for giving me an easy way to find cool women and men in the video game industry to follow on twitter!
#1reasonwhy Because I can't even give you examples of why because I'm too worried about/tired of dealing with backlash.
Ditto RT @fuzzybinary: Totally support #1reasonwhy and #1reasonmentor.  Can't follow it though, or I won't get any work done today!
Guys horrified at the #1reasonwhy? Step up. You may not be part of the problem, but be part of the solution. Make space, call peers out.
Big-site games journalists today: "#1reasonwhy is very important." Tomorrow: "Check out this awesome new misogynist piece of shit game!"
#1reasontobe Because the #1reasonwhy hashtag is only serving to make me MORE determined to make games.
@bboyer30 just click #1reasonwhy and it will pull up the tweets

Just read up on #1reasonwhy after seeing lots of it. It's shocking that it needs to exist in the first place but it's great that it does.
Some kids who were born after I started working professionally act as if women are muscling in on game culture #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy - The night Twitter took on the industry's sexism | GamesIndustry International http://t.co/dlwq2Xq8
You do not need anyone's permission to make games. It's brutal work if you want to be good, and it's never easy for anyone. #1ReasonWhy
#1reasonwhy - b/c of all the people responding to that tag w/: "ugh, just focus on the positive!" or dismissing the stories entirely.
This is what we live for.  #1reasonmentors #1reasonwhy
Because it's only dudes white knighting for chicks they'll never ever ever ever ever bang, and I'm laughing so hard right now. #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy because your studio never orders any women’s t-shirts in swag orders, and certainly not in sizes bigger than XS or S.

#1reasonwhy sexism in the game industry is wrong? Well, maybe because sexism is fucking disgusting.
Because the gaming industry is modeled more heavily on the movie industry than either wants to admit. #1reasonwhy

Because if I succeed, I'm exceptional. And if I fail, I'm proof that women shouldn't be in the industry. #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy b/c women still respond to negative comments with hurt feelings instead of proving commenters WRONG &amp; I'm a woman saying this

Lots of #1ReasonWhy tweets are pissing me off, but that Bayonetta one is the worst, fuck.
#1reasonwhy 'Not if you’re not fully utilizing half the talent in the country.' said Gates, to cheers from a segregated audience of women.
Is the #1reasonwhy trend supposed to be "One reason why I don't want to make video games"? Because that's the worst hashtag.
We'll just count that last tweet as my #1ReasonWhy.
Some kids who were born after I started working professionally act as if women are muscling in on game culture #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy Because the haters responding to this hashtag are your "audience". Would YOU want to do hard, underpaid work for these people?

A really awesome blog post from the lead writer of Dragon Age #1reasonwhy http://t.co/5wwUClb5
It's weird to see complaints of #1ReasonWhy being "too negative". I've found it important &amp; affirming, in an "I'm-not-alone kind" of way.
I'm mindblown over some of the #1ReasonWhy tweets. An industry full of intelligent people shouldn't act like such fucking morons to women.
If you're a guy, and your reaction to #1reasonwhy is
#1reasonwhy Their attempts to move up the corporate ladder by wearing short skirts and push up bras to work failed.
People think the female characters I design are actually men because they aren't "sexy" enough. #1reasonwhy
You a male gamer? Regardless of type, look at #1ReasonWhy...I hate that the hobby I love does this...let's change, 1 gamer at a time... rnb
I want to thank you folks. Everyone has been supportive of #1reasonwhy in my feed.
Dudes: Let #1reasonwhy wash over you and accept that maybe a lifetime as a dude hasn't made you an expert on what life is like for women.
Because (for the most part) "Fan Service" is an excuse to throw T&amp;A in where it doesn't add to a game. #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy Because my fellow female peers felt they needed to flirt and dress provocatively to get ahead. The saddest part is, it worked.

#1reasonwhy because I'm tired defending myself when I call myself a gamer or a geek.
The only time I ever was on a panel with a dude he told us he'd "stick his penis in all of us". #1reasonwhy
@thatsmytrunks It's #1reasonwhy there aren't more women in the videogame/tech/game making industry.
@jesshartley Whereas I see "Fan Service" as an excuse to throw in Daleks. :) #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy My daughter is a gamer too, and her only hero is "that chick from Portal."
The #1ReasonWhy has me wondering, how much of this happened under my nose as an employee for the industry and I was oblivious of it?
#1ReasonWhy because most of the female gamers I know are too afraid of being harassed to play Xbox Live with an open mic.
I'll stop with the #1reasonwhy tweets now. Sorry for spamming everyone. m(._.)m
Any of my smart and incisive writer-followers want to write about #1reasonwhy and women in games for xoJane? Lesley at xoJane dot com
#1reasonwhy When I ask a classmate if the believe in equal rights, they say "well yeah, but I hate feminism, its about unequal rights!"
#1reasonwhy Because my fellow female peers felt they needed to flirt and dress provocatively to get ahead. The saddest part is, it worked.
Dudes: Let #1reasonwhy wash over you and accept that maybe a lifetime as a dude hasn't made you an expert on what life is like for women.
if you are surprised at  #1reasonwhy, ask yourself  why women you know who experience this wont tell you about it.
I'm really liking this #1ReasonWhy movement, so I'll add my support. This sort of thing really should get more attention/action
#1reasonwhy Go show some support, guys and gals :)

Well, #1reasonwhy happened/is happening and is painfully shaming. But what are we going to do about it from here, industry?

Female game dev stories of #1reasonwhy are heartbreaking. Hoping to break free of those in game industry and engineering someday.
@robertflorence was wondering what the fuck #1reasonwhy was all about. All I saw was about 30 posts saying to check out #1reasonwhy.
Because if I succeed, I'm exceptional. And if I fail, I'm proof that women shouldn't be in the industry. #1reasonwhy

Being mistaken for male co-founder's assistant ...three times? four? #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy I'd say 50% of the women I've worked with in the industry are fucking useless at their jobs.. Which beats the 80-90% of men...
Can I suggest, if you have a spare moment, you check out the #1ReasonWhy discussion around sexism in the gaming industry? It's incredible.

With that said, #1reasonwhy also brings one point to mind, the arbitrary title of "girl gamer" needs to end. Stick with "gamer" if you need.

#1reasonwhy Because when I ask my classmates about games appealing to both genders, they say "fuck that, I'm not making it pink"

For example: the whole #1ReasonWhy, sexism in games thing? Messed up! Sexism is bad. Everyone should be treated respectfully.
#1reasonwhy When asked why many women don't like games; it's because most are made by groups of men that think they know what women want.
The ugly #1reasonwhy? Men are often guilty of silent complacency. We need to speak up and tell others that sexism isn't cool.

I've enjoyed #1reasonwhy. Women have as much right as men do to make and play the games they want to -- and not feel afraid to do so.
#1reasonwhy people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that don't change, even when people do.
Worried that #1reasonwhy just discouraged 5000 women from following their gamedev dreams. DON'T GIVE UP! Read #1reasontobe for positivity!

Because I was told I'd be remembered not on my own merits, but by who I was or was assumed to be sleeping with. #1reasonwhy

Here is my #1ReasonWhy -- written more than 4 years ago.  Contains discussion of sexism, racism, &amp; anti-queer bigotry: http://t.co/wffZBAgw
#1reasonwhy I've been accused of stalking, whoring myself out, and crying for attention because I want to be active in the VF community.
#1reasonwhy The saddest part about all this is reading the comments on various sites with articles about it. -.-
I had to make my own game in order to see someone like me as a main character #1ReasonWhy
#1reasonwhy Because I can't even give you examples of why because I'm too worried about/tired of dealing with backlash.

Writing on #1reasonwhy this morning. Feels like a lot of positive coming out of it - hope it’s sustained.
#1ReasonWhy everyone needs to stop being so touchie its really not that big of a deal that women don't make video games.
Because I feel like I am not welcome at E3 even though I have been making games for 31 years. #1reasonwhy
Guess I've been lucky: I've encountered 1 strong, successful, smart, driven, impressive woman after another in games for years. #1reasonwhy
Is there any non-sexist female protagonist in video games? Would love to play such a game for a change. #1reasonwhy
Based in the truth of that tweet, I’m not sure to cry or write this whole #1reasonwhy thing off.

@Madmenyo and men don't get harassed? #1reasonwhy and #feminism is just reverse sexism.
I've been asked to write about my experiences in relation to the #1reasonwhy tag and I'm.... actually scared to. Like this is scary.
@gigasube The Longest Journey, Dreamfall, Beyond Good &amp; Evil. Arguably Alyx in HL2:Episode 1 counts. It's not a long list. #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy is a hashtag worth following. Especially for all my friends in the industry.
Um, did #1reasonwhy really get covered by TIME, Slate, Mother Jones, and NBC? Am I staring at articles in French and German? Is this real?

@subversified That is absolutely terrible. This whole hashtag is like a big Capcom Tournament fiasco, but industry wide. #1ReasonWhy
#1reasonwhy and #1reasontobe are informative and great, can we get a #1waytohelpfixtheproblem?
The newest narrative pleasures of today come through games. What we need is more women stories, less stereotypes #1reasonwhy

Inspired by #1reasonwhy I have something to say about "trash talking" in tabletop gaming, but not on my blog. Any ideas where i can post?
@Brinstar Yeah. :/ The worst part about #1reasonwhy was hearing industry vets say that they have the same problems now they've always had.

Thanks to all the women in game dev who face #1ReasonWhy, but keep going; designing, developing and collaborating.
#1reasonwhy is, as men, most of us can't, won't or don't understand, and we don't try nearly enough to. Because it's hard. We can do better.
#1reasonwhy because my male colleagues are allowed to occasionally be obnoxious, silly, immature, annoying, drunk. i'm not.
#1reasonwhy because if men express anger, they're strong/powerful. If I express anger, I'm "overreacting/causing drama".

#1reasonwhy Because when we talk about these very real problems with rampant sexism, we get told to "stop bitching."
Such strong response today for #1reasonwhy says so much. Sad that in 2012 such divides persist. Reminder that we have so much to learn
#1ReasonWhy because all these stories make me cringe, and I live in a country that gave women the right to vote universally only in *1990*.

@DrNerdLove Have you heard about this thing called #1reasonwhy about sexism in the video game industry?  You might need to look into that.
@theworldofdavo All I know is what I'm going to do to make things better. What are you going to do to make things better? #1ReasonWhy
#1reasonwhy Because it's *still* considered acceptable industry wisdom to treat 47% female audience as "added bonus" but not who you target.
@Moistnuggets Speaking of which one of the #1reasonwhy complaints was about how we make a distinction about gender using the term FemShep
#1reasonwhy there are few women in game design: you can be brave 99% of the time, but be emotional once, and you get sideways looks.

#1reasonwhy people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that don't change, even when people do.
http://t.co/WYtwkOZx Well said, and a good viewpoint in regards to this whole #1ReasonWhy trend
#1reasonwhy because rather than embrace difference, gamers expect EVERYONE to make the same shit over and over for all eternity.
#1reasonwhy because game devlopers tend to be fans of that doctrine too and don't even try to see that new ideas could make better games...
#1reasonwhy ...and then women in games don't feel they can follow their instincts when they have to make games that are "popular"
#1reasonwhy ...women to work in this industry basically have to either be 'one ov the boys' or be cute or be invisible...
#1reasonwhy THESE ARE YOUR OPTIONS.

#1reasonwhy Because the metrics team was shocked to discover that girls liked our game at all. Weren't even trying for that "demographic"
#1ReasonWhy because your studio never orders any women’s t-shirts in swag orders, and certainly not in sizes bigger than XS or S.
#1reasonwhy because my male colleagues are allowed to occasionally be obnoxious, silly, immature, annoying, drunk. i'm not.

@micheinnz @SingleMaltGamer Oh, right, because when men complain, it's called "venting." When women do it, it's "bitching." #1reasonwhy
#1reasonwhy because @gamasutra illustrates its article about #1reasonwhy with a photo of high heels http://t.co/QOoxa3YW
Dudes: Let #1reasonwhy wash over you and accept that maybe a lifetime as a dude hasn't made you an expert on what life is like for women.
#1reasonwhy there are few women in game design: you can be brave 99% of the time, but be emotional once, and you get sideways looks.
#1reasonwhy Because creating appropriately dressed female characters is viewed as a rarity, rather than the norm.
1 Good thing to come of #1reasonwhy - gave me list of awesome women to follow on Twitter. I miss the games industry, sometimes. ;)
#1reasonwhy people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that don't change, even when people do.
Because I got blank states when I asked why a female soldier in a game I worked on looked like a porn star. #1reasonwhy
@BernardChapin Stop that mansplaining and grow a vagina! ;) #1reasonwhy

I uploaded a @YouTube video http://t.co/DHhfU2iX Why #1reasonwhy is a bad thing for gaming culture

Why are there so few female video game makers? #1reasonwhy has the answer http://t.co/PaP2AU2K
@MikaelSaker #1reasonwhy exists because people are always looking to pass the blame instead of finding a solution based around equality.
What I've learned from #1reasonwhy is that if you don't agree with the mob, you're branded a misogynist and a potential rapist.

@LAHalliday (Repeat 'cause of tagging error) What, according to you, are the "true issues"? #1ReasonWhy
@LAHalliday And I'm sure women aren't the only ones mistreated, but that doesn't lessen the sexism fact. Have to start somewhere #1reasonwhy
Because 50% is not a minority, #1reasonwhy is a chance to overhaul the entire industry for all minorities, one step at a time.
@LAHalliday #1reasonwhy isnt about misandry. There isn't any promotion of it. We don't hate men, we just want to be gamers. Not girl gamers.
Proof of hypocrisy of #1reasonwhy, I post one tweet before our podcast disagreeing and I am attacked for apparent misogyny. #DoubleStandard

The #1reasonwhy tag makes me sad. Its not about gender. We are all gamers, making it about gender ignores that fact.
@LAHalliday Gonna put this on #1ReasonWhy? Have you read the hashtag feed about the kinds of abuse women have been subjected to?
Calling it "pathetic." #imagine MT @LAHalliday: Proof of hypocrisy #1reasonwhy, I post one tweet disagreeing &amp; am attacked for misogyny.
#1reasonwhy gender discrimination is wrong, why cant this be about abuse in general? Why does there have to be a separation of gender here?
@LAHalliday #1reasonwhy represents us, as women, standing up against #sexism, so you're calling us and our effort pathetic. Same thing.
#1reasonwhy people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that don't change, even when people do.
Someone asked a question. Thousands answered. MT @LinkageAX: #1reasonwhy Why does there have to be a separation of gender here?
@LAHalliday @agentmaine you began by attacking the tag, therefore all of us who stand behind it. It was you who attacked first. #1reasonwhy
@LAHalliday you could have started out simply saying "we will discuss #1reasonwhy" but instead felt the need to say its pathetic. Attack.

@LinkageAX Yes, general abuse is wrong, but that has nothing to do with #1ReasonWhy. That was specifically about gender discrimination&gt;

@LAHalliday @LinkageAX I don't see what that has to do with it? #1ReasonWhy

#1reasonwhy I hate the fact I'm such a niche market for fps and MMORPGs I find it astounding that men are shocked when they find out i play

#1reasonwhy people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that don't change, even when people do.
I maintain that IGN and their copycat culture of "bro" shit will outpower #1ReasonWhy and similar attempts to reform sexism in gaming, sadly
@meta_gear Where's all this sexism in gaming? "Sexism" certainly hasn't stopped ppl from playing or working in the industry? #1reasonwhy
#1ReasonWhy this all sounds like a load of whiny shit it me: I've been playing games since the early 1980s...
#1ReasonWhy ...I was picked on and ridiculed. It was an unusual thing for a ten year old to do back then. But I got on with it...
#1ReasonWhy ...and now gaming and computers are acceptable pastimes, the same way women playing games WILL become acceptable...
#1ReasonWhy ...Unfortunatly, humans are nasty and thus we all have to pay our dues, something that seems to escape the Gen Y mentality.
@IanSchreiber Because all it takes to get 18 - 25 year old males interested in a game is either ultra violence or naked women... #1reasonwhy
@vicbstard "I had to put up with it, why shouldn't you?" is not an acceptable argument. #1reasonwhy
@thorgald why is that though? #1reasonwhy (rhetorical q, doesn't need an answer)
Bc asst. producer thought it was appropriate to tell me to "not make it an emotional thing" when I told him to stop interrupting #1reasonwhy
Because once I've been told "we don't need women in order to know what female players want from this industry" #1reasonwhy
Dudes: Let #1reasonwhy wash over you and accept that maybe a lifetime as a dude hasn't made you an expert on what life is like for women.
Even blatantly masculine workplace vibe is justified *if* you produce amazing art from it; but the industry is stagnant as shit #1ReasonWhy
